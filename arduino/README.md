# Arduino plate

As a part of project, an Arduino plate was provided as an example of IoT device, which serves as a data collector. This microcontroller allows connection of sensors from GroVe starter kit. 

However, most of these sensors are not strogly applicable for the goals of our project. Therefore, we use Arduino in a limited format, as a proof-of-concept device, to showcase our ability to work with microcontrollers.

The plate we got is a basic Arduino Uno R3, without Wi-Fi module. Thus, it was challenging to incorporate it directly with MQTT protocol. We then use
